# My FreeCodeCamp C# Advance Video follow-along repositories (finished)
  The video by GavinLon hosted by FreeCodeCamp was at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YT8s-90oDC0
  So this is a directory tree that I basically made some last commits and push up the parent folder to Github;
  it's good for my own future reference or anyone who is interested to see my sample follow-along work.

## C# Version Difference: I used C# .NET 8 

## Editors or IDEs used: vim, Visual Studio Community 2022, VS Code.

## Some other plugins used for vim: Omnisharp-vim (and variously other plugins that I typically use for productivity),
but the usual ones recommended by Microsoft such as C# Dev Kit for VS code is pretty good too. 

## Caveats I encountered during the follow-along:
I think there were some netstandard library issues that I had to change version back and forth between 2.0 and 2.1;
but otherwise it was all good; maybe I sideline saw some announcement in .NET Aspire that could potentially fix the assemblies or .dll libraries issues; not sure.
